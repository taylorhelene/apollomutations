# This is a project I did as part of the Apollo GrapQL Course

I have hosted it on render:

Here are the links for:

1. Frontend - https://trial-azpj.onrender.com
2. Server - https://server-80vk.onrender.com

## How the course was done

The codebase for the Front-end was partly provided by Apollo!

There are 3 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.
- `final`: The final stage of both the server and client folders, with all of the steps and code completed!

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

In another Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
